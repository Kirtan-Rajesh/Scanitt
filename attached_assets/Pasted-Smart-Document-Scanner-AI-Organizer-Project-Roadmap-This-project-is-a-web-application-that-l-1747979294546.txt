Smart Document Scanner & AI Organizer – Project
 Roadmap
 This project is a web application that lets users upload any document image (receipts, invoices, ID cards,
 notes, etc.), automatically detects the document region, applies perspective correction and image
 enhancements (using OpenCV), extracts text via OCR, and then uses an AI agent to analyze the content and
 categorize it into folders or tags. This fully-Python-based solution pairs a modern web stack (e.g. FastAPI
 backend and React/TypeScript frontend ) with computer vision and NLP. For example, a “full-stack
 FastAPI” template recommends FastAPI (Python) with SQLModel/PostgreSQL and a React+Vite frontend .
 The document processing pipeline will use OpenCV’s

 getPerspectiveTransform 
2
 and
 warpPerspective to deskew documents , plus adaptive thresholding/contrast fixes for a clean
 “scanned” look . OCR (Tesseract or a cloud API) converts the corrected image to text, and finally an LLM
based agent (via LangChain or similar) classifies the content into categories (bills, notes, IDs, etc.) by its
 textual content .

 Suggested Technology Stack
 • 
• 
• 
• 
Frontend: React (with TypeScript and a build tool like Vite), using a component library (e.g. Chakra
 UI) for rapid UI development
 1
 . React is well-suited for dynamic file-upload interfaces and tag
 management. 
Backend: Python with FastAPI for the web API. FastAPI is high-performance and supports async
 operations, Pydantic models, and automatic docs. (Alternatively, Flask or Django REST could be used,
 but FastAPI has built-in async and data validation .) 
Database: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for a lightweight prototype), accessed via an ORM (SQLModel or
 SQLAlchemy) as in the FastAPI template
 1
 1
 . This stores user data, document metadata (filenames,
 categories, tags), and OCR text. 
Document Processing: OpenCV (Python) for computer vision tasks. Use OpenCV to detect edges/
 contours of the document in the photo, compute a 4-point perspective transform, and apply 
cv2.warpPerspective to straighten it
 2
 . Then apply grayscale conversion and adaptive
 thresholding/contrast (e.g. 
• 
• 
• 
3
 cv2.adaptiveThreshold ) to enhance readability like a real scan . 
OCR: Tesseract OCR (via pytesseract) or a cloud OCR API (Google Vision, AWS Textract) to extract text
 from the processed image. The text is passed to the AI module. 
AI Agent / NLP: A language model (LLM) to interpret the extracted text and decide categories/tags.
 We can use a framework like LangChain or LangGraph to orchestrate prompts to the LLM.
 LangChain’s LangGraph supports building stateful AI workflows and agentic reasoning . For
 example, we might prompt the LLM to “Given this receipt text, classify it as invoice, receipt, ID, or
 note, and extract key fields.” 
LLM/API Choices: For NLP sorting, cloud APIs like OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o) or Cohere can be used.
 Alternatively, open-source LLMs (Hugging Face models) enable local inference: e.g. Meta’s LLaMA (v3
 or v4, released 2025) or Mistral-7B. In practice, a local model like Mistral-7B has been used
 successfully for receipt parsing to keep data on-device .

• 
Infrastructure: Docker Compose for local development and deployment. Optionally use Traefik or
 Nginx as a reverse proxy for HTTPS and scaling. Continuous integration (GitHub Actions) and
 deployment scripts should be included (the FastAPI template includes these out of the box ).

Frontend App (Developer 1): A React app for the user interface. It provides: 
File Upload UI: Allow users to upload images or capture via camera. Show upload progress. 
Document Viewer: After processing, display the corrected/scanned image and extracted text
 preview. 
Category/Tag Browser: Let users browse or search their processed documents by folder or tag.
 Show folders like “Invoices”, “Receipts”, etc. 
Settings & Export: Options to name files, download scans (as image/PDF), or tag documents
 manually. 
2
 3
 Optional UI features: Login/Logout screens, profile page. 
Backend API (Developer 2): A FastAPI service with endpoints: 
Upload Endpoint: Accepts an image, saves it, and triggers processing. 
Processing Endpoint: Runs the OpenCV pipeline on the image (edge detection, warp, enhancement)
 . 
OCR Endpoint: Calls Tesseract (or OCR API) to get text from the image. 
AI Sorting Endpoint: Sends text to the LLM agent/chain (e.g. LangChain) to classify and return tags/
 categories. For example, the agent might run a chain: extract key entities (dates, amounts) and then
 pick a category. 
Data Endpoints: CRUD APIs to store/retrieve document metadata, tags, and user info from the
 database. 
Document Processing Module (Developer 2): Python code (could be part of the backend) for the CV
 pipeline: 
Edge Detection: Use OpenCV (Canny or contour finding) to detect the largest quadrilateral (the
 document) in the photo. 
6
 7
 2
 3
 Perspective Correction: Compute perspective transform (cv2.getPerspectiveTransform +
 warpPerspective) to “flat-scan” the document . 
Image Enhancement: Convert to grayscale and apply adaptive thresholding or contrast adjustment
 to mimic a scanned page . 
OCR Module (Developer 2): Integrate Tesseract (pytesseract) to convert the enhanced image into
 raw text. This may also include pre/post-processing (denoising, splitting text by lines). 
AI Sorting Module (Developers 1 & 2 collaboration):
 Use LangChain/LangGraph to build a prompt chain or agent that takes OCR text and returns a
 category/tag. LangGraph allows constructing multi-step agents (e.g. parse JSON, call tools, include
 human-in-loop) . 
Example approach: define categories (“receipt”, “invoice”, “id card”, “note”), provide examples in the
 prompt, and ask the LLM to label the text. The LLM’s answer can then be parsed into a tag. 
One can also use an embeddings+retrieval approach: embed the text (OpenAI or Cohere
 embeddings) and use a vector DB (e.g. Pinecone or FAISS) with labeled examples to do classification. 
Storage & Database (Developer 2):
 File Storage: Store the original and processed images. This can be local disk (for prototype) or a
 cloud bucket (AWS S3 or GCS) for scale. 
2
• 
• 
• 
• 
Database: Store metadata in PostgreSQL or SQLite: user info, file records (filename, upload date,
 tags), OCR text, etc. Use an ORM (SQLModel) for schema and migrations. 
Authentication (Optional, Dev 1/2):
 9
 9
 Implement user accounts so multiple users can have separate document libraries. Use JWT tokens
 for API auth (FastAPI provides easy JWT integration ). 
Provide secure password storage (FastAPI template includes hashed passwords and JWT out of the
 box ). 
Team Roles & Responsibilities
 • 
• 
• 
• 
Developer 1 (Frontend & Integration):
 Build the React frontend: pages for upload, document gallery, and settings. Use React Router or
 Next.js for navigation. 
Implement the file-upload component (HTML 
<input type="file"> or camera capture). Handle
 f
 ile previews and upload progress. 
Consume backend APIs: send images to backend, display returned scanned image and tags. Show
 categorized folders or tag lists. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
(Optional) Implement user authentication in the UI: login/signup forms, handle JWT tokens for API
 calls. 
Style the UI (e.g. with Chakra UI or Material-UI) for a clean, modern look. 
Develop any mobile-responsive design for users scanning from phones. 
Developer 2 (Backend & Processing):
 Set up the FastAPI server with necessary routes and middleware. Create Pydantic models for
 request/response schemas. 
Implement the document processing pipeline in Python: edge detection and perspective transform
 using OpenCV (cv2)
 2
 3
 , and image enhancement (thresholding, filtering) . 
Integrate OCR (pytesseract) and handle any text cleaning. 
Integrate the AI sorting: set up LangChain/LangGraph code, write prompts or agent code for
 classification. Experiment with LLM providers (OpenAI API or local HF model) to get reliable category
 labels. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Design the database schema (documents table, tags table, user table, etc.) and implement data
 storage logic. 
Ensure endpoints handle errors (bad images, missing fields) gracefully. 
(Optional) Implement authentication logic in FastAPI (JWT issuing, password reset) as guided by the
 FastAPI template . 
9
 Shared/DevOps (Both):
 Set up the project repository with clear folder structure and README. 
Write unit and integration tests (FastAPI + React). FastAPI template suggests using Pytest . 
Configure Docker Compose: one service for the backend, one for the frontend, and one for the
 database. Ensure easy startup and environment config. 
Set up a CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions) for testing and deployment. 
Collaborate on API design: agree on request/response formats and data models.

 This structure cleanly separates the front-end and back-end codebases. Each module is focused: e.g.
 processing.py contains only CV code, 
ai_agent.py contains the LLM logic. The 
models.py and
 database.py hold all data modeling (as in the FastAPI template ). The frontend has logical React
 component folders. Docker files at the root tie everything together.

AI Models & NLP Services
 For classifying document content and sorting:
 • 
• 
• 
Cloud LLM APIs: OpenAI’s GPT-4/GPT-4o or Cohere’s API can be used via LangChain prompts to
 classify text. These models excel at understanding context (e.g. “This text reads like a bill from a
 utility company”).
 Open-Source LLMs: If data privacy or cost is a concern, use local models. For example, Meta’s
 LLaMA-4 (April 2025) is an open high-performance model
 has been demonstrated for receipt parsing
 5
 11
 . A smaller 7B model like Mistral-7B
 . LangChain can interface with these via Hugging Face
 or a local server.
 Embeddings & Classification: Alternatively, use vector embeddings (OpenAI, Cohere, or open
source embeddings like SBERT) and a simple nearest-neighbor against a small labeled dataset. Then
 use a threshold or a simple classifier on the embedding space.
 • 
• 
LangChain / LangGraph: Use LangChain’s agent tools for complex workflows. LangGraph (part of
 LangChain) helps build multi-step, stateful agents with human-in-the-loop if needed . For
 example, an agent might extract key fields (date, amount) and then decide the folder. LangGraph’s
 streaming and execution control features make it robust for production.
 Prompt Engineering: Craft prompts carefully. An example prompt: “Below is the text extracted from a
 document image. Identify its type: Receipt, Invoice, ID Card, or Note. Provide a JSON with 
6
 7
 { "type": 
<category>, "tags": [<keywords>] } .” LangChain can enforce JSON output (via models that
 support structured output).
 Optional Extensions
 • 
• 
User Accounts & Authentication: Allow users to sign up and log in. FastAPI’s full-stack template
 already includes JWT auth and password reset flow . This extension ensures each user’s
 documents are private.
 9
 Full-Text Search: Implement searching across all OCR text. This could use a simple SQL full-text
 index, or an external engine (Elasticsearch). Alternatively, use a vector search: embed each doc’s text
 and index in Pinecone/Weaviate for semantic search.
 • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Advanced Tagging: Let users add/edit tags or correct AI-suggested categories. Build a feedback
 loop: if a user recategorizes a document, store that correction to refine the model.
 Export & Sharing: Allow exporting documents as PDF (pack multiple pages) or CSV of extracted
 data. Offer integration to email or cloud drives (Dropbox/Google Drive).
 Notifications/Alerts: (Long-term) Notify users of documents, e.g. “You have 5 unread bills from last
 month.” This could use scheduled jobs.
 Mobile-Friendly Design: Since scanning often involves a phone camera, ensure the frontend works
 well on mobile screens. Perhaps even add a mobile app or a PWA for offline scanning.
 Audit Trail & Logs: For a production demo, add logging and monitoring (errors from OCR/AI) and an
 admin panel to view system metrics.
 This roadmap lays out a clear, modular plan. It uses proven technologies (FastAPI, React, OpenCV) and
 modern AI frameworks (LangChain, GPT) to create a production-ready scanning + sorting app. Each
 component is assigned to ensure two developers have balanced, clearly defined tasks. The resulting project– documented and well-structured – can be showcased as an end-to-end Python/AI web application in a
 resume or portfolio.

 Sources: We base our architecture on modern full-stack best practices (FastAPI + React ) and established
 document-processing techniques (perspective transform , image thresholding , LLM-powered
 classification ). LangChain and LangGraph enable sophisticated agent workflows . All cited
 references inform these choices to ensure a robust, cutting-edge solution.
